                        <h2>The General Stuff</h2>
                        <p>Hey, I'm Nicholas Swift. I'm a programmer and a game developer currently living in Seattle, Washington.</p>
                        <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/Nicholas-Swift" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for my code, check out my <a href="https://www.codeeval.com/profile/Nicholas-Swift/" target="_blank">CodeEval</a> for my coding prowess, find my projects on the <a href="portfolio">portfolio page</a>, and you can contact me on the <a href="contact">contact page</a>.</p>

                    <div class="box">
                        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
                        <p>I picked up my first programming book, Beginning C++ Through Game Programming (Third Edition), my freshman year of high school and it's been a whirlwind of code since then.</p>
                        <p>In my senior year of high school, I really started honing my skills. I picked up the SFML framework and started working on 2D game development with a focus on creating a fully functional game and becoming a better programmer.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I am working on larger projects which you can find on my <a href="portfolio">portfolio page</a>. I'm still writing my own engines and tools, but I'm really honing all of my focus into creating fully functional and distributable programs. I'm extremely happy with the way my current two have shaped up, and I think you'll be extremely excited to find out what's coming next.</p>

                        <h2>A Life Abroad</h2>
                        <p>Not to confuse, I'm currently living in San Francisco. However, I was born in Phuket, Thailand and have spent most of my life there.</p>
                        <p>I'm half-Thai, half-American and a third culture kid through and through. I've had myriad experiences and opportunities from living overseas that have influenced my educational goals and my life goals.</p>
                        <p>My passion for technology combined with these traits pushes me further and further into this ever changing world that is the tech industry. With a burning curiosity for everything around me and a mental vitality that pushes me to dedicate myself to any task I set my mind to, I set forth on a path that leads me into a world where the only constant is change.</p>
